## Network Logs and Source Code of Prison Telecommunications Video Calling Apps Analyzed for The American Prospect

This project contains `.har` log files of network activity collected between 5/10/2021 and 5/12/2021 during video calls on the web applications of Global Tel Link, HomeWAV, and TurnKey Communications. These `.har` files were exported from Google Chrome. It also conatins javascript source code of prison telecommunications video calling web applications, and decompiled source code of Android applications.

The network log files show calls back to Twilio [video servers](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/ip-addresses) during video visits initiated in prison telecommunications apps. The javascript and java source code show that these apps rely on Twilio Video SDKs and use them in business logic.
