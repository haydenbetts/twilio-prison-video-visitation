# Network Logs and Source Code Analyzed for The American Prospect

This project contains javascript source code of prison telecommunications video calling web applications, and decompiled source code of Android applications. It also contains `.har` log files of network activity collected between 5/10/2021 and 5/12/2021 and exported from Google Chrome.

The network log files show calls back to Twilio [video servers](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/ip-addresses) during video visits initiated in prison telecommunications apps. The javascript and java source code show that these apps rely on Twilio Video SDKs and use them in business logic.
